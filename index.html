As you continue to do this, it will get easier to get up, and you will be more motivated to start working.<br> • If it is hard for you to get up and start working, start by having one small task to accomplish, and you can go back to bed after.

There is opportunity to be found in any seemingly negative situation.<br> • When you find yourself not doing well, be kind to yourself. Otherwise you will find yourself falling into a downward spiral. Give yourself gentle nudges when you are failing, and praise when you are succeeding.<br> • Rather than comparing yourself to someone else, compare yourself to who you were yesterday.<br> • Remind yourself why you are trying to get a degree. By focusing on the goal rather than the task, it will be easier to remain optimistic and motivated.

			                                • If starting small is too difficult, start tiny. Start with your name on a document or a list of at least one tiny thing you need to do. The more you practice with this, the easier it will become.</p>
