						Even when classes are in-person, students often have difficulties with time management, especially those who work, have families, or have other responsibilities.<br>

							<br><br>
							There are many ways to maintain a schedule. Google calendar is a great way to do this.<br>
							If you prefer a hard copy to a digital copy, paper calendars, to-do lists, and sticky notes are a great way to keep yourself on track.<br>
							It is also important to track your schedule for classtimes and due dates, so as to not let anything fall through the cracks.<br>
							Blackboard provides a calendar and a to-do list that tells you when you will have assignments due.
